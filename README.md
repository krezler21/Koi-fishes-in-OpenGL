# Koi-fishes-in-OpenGL
The project represents animated models of koi fish inspired by the animation "Avatar: The Last Airbender"

## Motivation and Project Description
This project was developed as part of the "Computer Graphics" course for the final assessment. The central concept involves the animation of fish models orbiting around the moon, which serves as the light source and rotates counter to the movement of the fishes.

To bring my vision to life, I utilized existing solutions such as the universe, moon, and koi carp models. However, I modified textures, ensuring a close resemblance to the koi carps featured in the animation. 
Furthermore, I personally implemented the movement of the models, camera and the lighting effects and the camera movement.
