# Koi-fishes-in-OpenGL
The project represents animated models of koi fish inspired by the animation "Avatar: The Last Airbender"

## Motivation and Project Description
This project was developed as part of the "Computer Graphics" course for the final assessment. The central concept involves the animation of fish models orbiting around the moon, which serves as the light source and rotates counter to the movement of the fishes.

To bring my vision to life, I utilized existing solutions such as the universe, moon, and koi carp models. However, I modified textures, ensuring a close resemblance to the koi carps featured in the animation. 
Furthermore, I personally implemented the movement of the models, the lighting effects and the camera movement.

## Installation
To launch my program I recommend you to do this via "Visual studio". After downloading the files from this repository, locate the "KoiFishes.sln" file in the "Code" folder and run it. The code, along with the necessary libraries, should be ready to run. 

However, during the project startup, an error related to model loading may occur. Despite this error, the program should launch after pressing the "Continue" button three times.

## Code Listing
The project utilizes the following libraries:

- **OpenGL** – a graphics library
- **GLFW** – a library enabling window, context, keyboard, and mouse management for OpenGL
- **GLEW** – a library assisting in querying and loading OpenGL extensions
- **GLM** – a mathematical library
- **STB** - a library allowing for texture usage
